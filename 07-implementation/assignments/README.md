# Exercise Construction and Testing
## CS4320/7320 Software Engineering






I wrote 10 tests in 'my_tests.py' 6 of them failed and 4 passed. 
I am stuck at solving TypeErrors. Apparently there are 4 of them and 2 of the errors are attribute Errors.
I will refine my tests and add additional 5 tests in the next assignment.

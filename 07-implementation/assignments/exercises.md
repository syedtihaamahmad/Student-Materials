# Exercises
1. Perform steps outlined in assignment, in the [README.md](./README.md) file in this directory. Submit your progress, along with a description of how far you got, and where you got stuck. You will have an opportunity to submit with all tests correct in the next module. 
2. Participate in the Discord Channel on Construction and Testing, helping your course mates when they get "stuck", or soliciting mutual aid when you are "stuck". If you have not already joined, here is a link: https://discord.gg/ACMShYGn

# 03-sprint-3 Notes

1. Build a full working model of your entire project. It does not have to be perfect, but you need to have at least: 
 - Wireframes
 - Stubs
 - All classes with method signatures named
 - between 20% and 50% of all the code "working". Not necessarily in a finished state, but "working". 

2. Update your design document and requirements to reflect any changes. 
3. You should have a testing plan. This will vary by the context of your project.
4. You should refresh the GitHub repository you are using from the current release so that, when you do a pull request into AUGUR at the end of the sprint, you are working from a current state. 
5. Create a folder with your team name for all sprint related documents

# Semester Project

## Setting up student meeting times
1. Each team will have a virtual deployment machine that I provide. It will have sufficient disk space and 12 GB of virtual RAM. 
2. We will work together to discuss the requirements you will work on, and organize your projects. 
3. Times I have set aside right now are: 
    - TBD
    - Going to occur between Monday, October 24, and Saturday, October 30.
4. You will each have an populated Augur Database at your disposal, and installed for you in your VM. It will have data from a set of around 100 Open Source Software Projects. There are three repositories you can use in different combinations to address the requirements for your project. 
    - https://github.com/chaoss/augur (required)
    - https://github.com/chaoss/augur-community-reports 
    - https://github.com/augurlabs/augur_view 
    - https://github.com/sandiego-rh/explorer

## Resources for Getting Started and Requirements (All groups need at least one use case, including the diagram. Some groups may be able to more easily express the details of their requirements narratively or in the spreadsheet template from the requirements module)
